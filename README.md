# Andrew Ng Machine Learning Specialization

> After taking Andrew Ng's ML course I decided to apply my knowledge. It culminated in Pupper, the robot dog.

## The notebook
I created an interactive notebook for the programming assignments in the Andrew Ng Machine Learning Specialization on Coursera. It includes pages of notes, with images referencing Andrew's slides, as well as juptyer notebooks for each programming assignment.

_Note_: Please do not copy the answers to the assignments it won't help you learn at all. I created this notebook to help me learn and I hope it helps you too.


## Process
In completing this project I went through several design fazes as seen in these projects: [learning](https://github.com/mrElnekave/lab1-2), and implementing the first [robot hands](https://github.com/mrElnekave/reacher-lab)
