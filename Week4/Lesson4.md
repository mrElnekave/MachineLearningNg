## Neural Networks

### Smart feature engineers

- Neural networks are a way to learn features automatically, each neuron takes a bunch of inputs and then decides if the feature it represents is present or not.

> In this example we have the first layer notice basic lines in the image, the second face parts, now the third can check if certain face parts are present to determine if a face type is present. Finally, based on the combination of face types, we can determine if a specific person is present.

### Notation

- We use the following notation for neural networks: Each layer is represented by a superscript in square brackets. So w<sub>2</sub><sup>[1]</sup> is the second weight for layer 1.
